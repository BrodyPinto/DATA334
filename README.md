# DATA334 - Data Visualization

## Course Overview:

DATA/STAT 334 focuses on the principles and techniques of data visualization, building on previous coursework in data analysis and statistics. Over the course of the semester, students will learn to create effective, ethical data visualizations using R and R Studio, and how to communicate data-driven insights. A significant part of the course is devoted to a final project, where students will conduct an in-depth analysis of one or more data sets, using visualization as a key tool.

##Key Learning Objectives:

 - Master the creation of compelling and accurate data visualizations using R and R Studio.
 - Understand what constitutes "good" and "poor" data visualization, and the ethical considerations in presenting data.
 - Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration on visualization projects.
 - Create a larger-scale final project involving complex visual analysis of real-world data sets.
 - Discuss and critique data visualizations in blog posts hosted via GitHub Pages using Quarto.

## Tools & Technologies:

 - R & R Studio: Core tools for creating data visualizations, including integration with Git.
 - Git & GitHub: Used for version control, collaboration, and publishing blog posts.
 - Shiny: Learn how to create interactive web applications for visualizing data in the later stages of the course.
